Algorithm:
==========

Initialize all sensors

Initialize X to 5
Initialize D to some large steps to cover slapping
Initialize B to small number of steps to cover bluffing

Initialize count to zero

* Loop until button is pressed 
* If Touch sensor is pressed
	* Loop until count reaches X
		* generate a random number (p) between 0 and 1
		* if p is 0 (corresponds to slaps)
			* Move swatter D degrees (slapping) Clockwise
			* Move swatter D degrees (slapping) Counter Clockwise
			* if swatter hits the user.
				* Turn red led on and buzzer
			* else 
		 		* Turn green led on and light 2 more slots of Led bar.
			* increment count
		* else (corresponds to bluff)
			* Move swatter B degrees clockwise
			* Move swatter B degrees counter clockwise
